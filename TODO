    MathJax_Main-regular.woff
    MathJax_Main-Regular.otf missing
☐ issues with multi-choice and true-false in interactive videos
☐ check if re-rendering when changing the DOM can be further restricted to the actually changed parts of the DOM
☐ provide fallback for MutationObserver
☐ check if getting the path of the currently running js-file can be detected in a more elegant way.
✔ limit MathJax to container element
✔ apply MathJax to dynamically added / changed elements in DOM
