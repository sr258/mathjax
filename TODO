☐ avoid that mathjax 'Typeset' is queued when MathJax is still rendering the initial run.
☐ try to remove visible step-by-step rendering
☐ check if re-rendering when changing the DOM can be further restricted to the actually changed parts of the DOM
☐ provide fallback for MutationObserver
☐ check if getting the path of the currently running js-file can be detected in a more elegant way.
✔ limit MathJax to container element
✔ apply MathJax to dynamically added / changed elements in DOM
